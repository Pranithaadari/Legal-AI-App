**Advanced AI-Driven Legal Document Summarization and Risk Assessment**

**Legal Document Summarization:**

I systems summarize lengthy legal documents into concise, easy-to-understand summaries.

They highlight key clauses, obligations, deadlines, and critical points.

**Risk Assessment:**

AI analyzes legal documents to detect potential risks, such as ambiguous clauses, penalties, regulatory compliance issues, or high-liability terms.

Provides actionable recommendations for risk mitigation.

**Question-Answering (Q&A):**

Advanced models can answer user-specific questions about the document, enabling quick information retrieval.

**Key Components**

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**

NLP models, such as GPT or BERT, are used to process legal language.

They can interpret complex legal jargon, identify critical clauses, and generate summaries.

**Machine Learning Models:**

Models trained on large datasets of legal documents identify patterns, risks, and important terms.

These models are often fine-tuned for specific industries, such as finance, real estate, or healthcare.

**Document Parsing and Extraction:**

Tools extract structured data from various formats (PDFs, DOCX, scanned files).

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is used for scanned documents.

**Risk Scoring:**

Quantifies risks by assigning a "risk score" based on the analysis of clauses, compliance requirements, and liability.

**Steps:**

**1.Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/Pranithaadari/Legal-AI-App

**2.Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**3.Configure API Keys**

1.**Google sheet APIs**:Allows developers to programmatically read, write, and manage Google Sheets data, enabling seamless integration with applications and automated workflows.

2.**Gmail Alert**:Notifies users of new emails, updates, or security events directly via pop-ups, notifications, or linked devices.

**Steps:**

1.**Google Sheet APIs**:

-Sign in to the Google cloud console.

-Obtain those API keys and google sheet id

-Then apply them to project.ipynb

**2.Gmail Alert:**

-sign in to the google app passwords

-it will generate one-time code

-then apply them in the project.ipynb

**4.Develop an app**

-Develop an app using the streamlit framework

**5.Run the Application:**

Run the Streamlit app

 streamlit run app.py

**Project Files:**

app.py:Main Application script

CSV file:Sample data for risk analysis and recommendations

project.ipynb:List of dependencies and the document analysis and their recommendations

**Outcomes:**

1.Document Parsing and Contextual Summarization Engine

Extracts key information from legal documents and generates concise summaries.

2.Risk Detection and Recommendation System

Identifies potential risks by cross-referencing clauses for hidden obligations or dependencies.D :

3.Continuous Regulatory Update Tracker

Monitors regulatory changes and integrates updates into ongoing contract analysis.

4.Platform Integration and Interactive Dashboard

Integrates with email accounts, Google Sheets, and provides an interactive dashboard for document tracking and alerts.
